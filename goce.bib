   abstract    = {Self-stabilizing systems can automatically recover from
                 arbitrary state perturbations in finite time. They are
                 therefore well-suited for dynamic, failure prone
                 environments. Spanning-tree construction in distributed
                 systems is a fundamental task which forms the basis for
                 many other network algorithms (like token circulation or
                 routing).This paper surveys self-stabilizing algorithms
                 that construct a spanning tree within a network of
                 processing entities. Lower bounds and related work are
                 also discussed.},
