@inproceedings{whyhigh,
	Annote = {futher notes on published version:
To identify circuitousness along the reverse path, WhyHigh uses three different techniques. First, it uses a significant RTT increase on a single hop of the traceroute to be an indicator of reverse path inflation. A packet that traverses any single link usually experiences a one-way latency of at most 40ms. We observed one-way link latencies to be less than 40ms on various long distance links that span thousands of miles (e.g., from coast to coast in the US, trans-Pacific, trans-Atlantic, and across Asia). Hence, an increase of 100ms or more in the RTT measured on successive hops of a traceroute likely indicates that the reverse path back from the latter hop is asymmetric. Second, the return TTL on the response from a probed interface provides an estimate of the length of the reverse path back from the interface. Therefore, a significant drop in the return TTL on pings to two successive interfaces on the traceroute implies that the reverse path back from at least one of the hops is asymmetric; comparison with forward TTLs tells us which one.
However, changes in RTT and return TTL across hops only pro- vide hints about inflation on the reverse path. These do not suffice to identify the exact path taken by packets from the client to the node. To gain partial visibility into the reverse path, WhyHigh uses flow records gathered at border routers in Google's network;

root causes:
- lack of peering
- limited bandwidth (even though they peer)
- routing misconfiguration (direct peering link used on forward, but infer circuitious reverse).  Peering AS needs to be contact to correct routing configuration
- traffic engineering (when a non peer uses a longer AS path than is available)


served by CDN nodes active for less than a year. Second, clients in most prefixes incur significant latency overheads due to queueing of packets. Isolating the cause or fixing the overheads caused by packet queueing is beyond the scope of this paper.  While our data does not enable us to determine whether packets are being queued in routers, in access links, or within the operating system of clients, large queueing delays have previously been measured [4] on the access links of end-hosts.

previosly titled:
Troubleshooting Latency-based Server Selection: Why Bringing the Server Near does not Improve Performance
WhyHigh-- Harsha's paper w Google
IMC 2009 submission (notes below on earlier NSDI 2009 submission)
- queueing delays often override the benefits of interacting w a nearby server- "connections to most clients are affected"
- prioritizes which to investigate by common AS path or by common CDN node
- google gathers a latency map by occassionally redirecting to a random CDN node and monitoring TCP
- redirection is actually based on prefix of DNS nameserver resolving for the client
- 40% of connections more than 500ms!
- since measuring RTT from small SYN/ACK packets, transmission delay should be small, so propogation + queueing
- clients in 80% of prefixes are served by the nearest (geographically) node, and 92% to one that is within 10ms of nearest (though may not be true for new nodes in CDN)
- in assessing prop delay, they assume the min delay has no queueing bc they have enough samples to factor it out
- capture queueing by comparing MEDIAN for prefix to min for region, instead of MIN for prefix
-- 40% of prefixes have latency 50ms more than region min
- although 60% of paths change on back to back days (of the 10K prefixes that have median RTT 50ms > min RTT), these ones have identical RTT diff distribution to those that don't change
-- as they point out, doesnt account for rev path changes or for finer granularity changes
- inflation usually affects all prefixes served by a particular AS path, or none, so can group by common path
- how does it look if you don't look across prefix but rather across client?  do some clients account for all the low values?  
-- compare median to client to min to prefix
-- 1/2 prefixes have 1/2 clients with 50ms median inflation
-- 25% prefixes have 80% clients inflated
-- queueing latency inflation seems widespread
-- they do not address trying to isolate the queueing problem

Questions/Suggestions sent to harsha
----------
- the definition of non-identical in the last full para on pg 6 is unclear.  first you say you do it based on IP-level, then you mention PoPs.  which does the 6K number correspond to?  if IP, why mention PoPs?  if PoP, why mention the IP level comparison?
- why not look at rev TTL for min vs median comparison (to see if path is changing)?  do you have it?
- a bit weird to spend time showing how queueing is important, then abandon it.  i didn't go back to see if you did, but make sure to set up the expectation for this.  also might want to speculate a bit about what google could do about the problem
- 4.2 quibble: BGP doesn't necessarily tell you all the alternative paths, does it?  also it is not at all clear what you use the BGP data for.  I guess eventually in 4.5 you use it to identify "Lack of peering," but it is pretty unclear in 4.2 what is coming.
- if you're not tracerouting all the way to the destination, how do you know that a jump in latency to an intermediate node has anything to do with the e2e latency (vs taking a different reverse path back)?
- in 4.3, do you require them to share the entire path to group, or just a segment of the path?  i would think that looking at a common intermediate shared path serving multiple edge ASes would be useful
- 4.4 "unlike previously seen in Figure 3."  The phrase makes it sound like Fig3 showed that it was not the case that new nodes had many prefixes redirected elsewhere, whereas I think what you mean is that Fig 3 showed that overall nodes do not have prefixes redirected elsewhere (and Fig 9 shows that new nodes are the ones that do).
- in 4.5, I don't get how you can differentiate between limited bandwidth, misconfiguration, and traffic engineering cases.  I understand you assume each of them in different cases, but I don't understand how the observations lead to the conclusions/ how they rule out the other possibilities.  Are these just guesses based on the resolution of the cases studies in 5.1?
- Table 1 could use some bolding or indentation to indicate which rows are subrows of others.  As is, I think tables often suggest that the rows are non-overlapping.  Also, are Circuitous Fwd/Rev mutually exclusive?  
- Fig 15 captures fraction inflated paths via transit vs peering, but don't we need to know what overall fraction of paths are transit/peering to judge this graph?
- section 6.  want to throw in a reference to rev tr, say the RIPE or NANOG talk?  or the report we have up on the web.
-------------

NSDI 2009 submission, rejected.  
- replicating content across geographically distributed servers and redirecting clients to closest in terms of latency has emerged as common (CDN)
- most comment redirection is based on latency
- main result: does not guarantee improvements in client performance
- inflation of latencies caused by inefficient Internet routing causes cases of being redirected to father away server
- must identify and troubleshoot sub-optimal paths
- want a way to pinpoint cause of inflation to an AS and identify root cause/ techniques to solve
- major challenge was LACK OF VISIBILITY into reverse path and lack of existing tools to give this view
-- "One of the challenges we faced in identifying network paths with inflated latencies was lack of visibility into the reverse path from the client.  This is specially significant because of the adundance of asymmetric paths in the Internet and the surprising lack of existing tools that can give us this view into the network."
- Netflow records identify entry point, but otherwise you need a node there
- 22% of prefixes experience more than 50ms latency over min for region
- 55% for prefixes served by new CDN nodes (IMC paper claims 45% instead)
- believe path inflation is one of the main causes
- even being redirected to nearest node is not enough
- heuristics to guess when it is reverse path, but only get some cases
- peer w japanese ISP in japan, but inflated reverse path suggested by RTT jump across hops, change in rev TTL, flow records in US.  a legacy of the contect provider's earlier presence in the US only

- once you identify, can influence issues by either advertising more specifics or by influencing the other ISP

LIMITATIONS
- RTT > 500ms from a node in Asia to a bunch of prefixes in Taiwan
- flow records don't explain inflation
- lack of evidence means suspicion of inflation along reverse path is just a theory
- they believe the key limitation is a lack of information about reverse paths from clients back to CDN nodes
- "It is not perfect.  This is a consequence of WhyHigh's partial view of Internet routing and incomplete knowledge of AS boundaries.  In order to more precisely troubleshoot problems and overcome limitations of the current system, we believe WhHigh needs the ability to gather information about the reverse path back from clients to Google's nodes."},

	Abstract = {Upgrading the software of long-lived,
                  highly-available distributed systems is
                  difficult. It is not possible to upgrade all the
                  nodes in a system at once, since some nodes may be
                  unavailable and halting the system for an upgrade is
                  unacceptable. Instead, upgrades must happen
                  gradually, and there may be long periods of time
                  when different nodes run different software versions
                  and need to communicate using incompatible
                  protocols. We present a methodology and
                  infrastructure that make it possible to upgrade
                  distributed systems automatically while limiting
                  service disruption. We introduce new ways to reason
                  about correctness in a multi-version system. We also
                  describe a prototype implementation that supports
                  automatic upgrades with modest overhead.},

	Contribution1 = {This technique is very generic: it allows objects to be replaced with versions containing arbitrary modifications; versions can be incompatible as long as the programmers can define invariants between the states of the two objects. Some methods may have to be disallowed for this purpose, but they will eventually be enabled. Temporarily disallowing APIs makes sense in RPC-based distributed systems because communication errors may happen anytime and programs are written to handle this situation.},
	Contribution2 = {Other advantages of this approach: it allows the distributed system to provide continuous service (even though individual nodes are unavailable while they upgrade), upgrades are defined at a central location and they propagate through the system, objects are upgrading according to a schedule that may take into account the impact on performance (distributed ``scheduling functions'' are attached to each upgrade).},

	Abstract = {Several dynamic software-based updating systems that
                  are in the research and production stages are
                  described. In particular, the procedure-oriented
                  dynamic updating system (PODUS) is discussed. In
                  PODUS, a program is updated by loading the new
                  version of the program and replacing each old
                  procedure with its corresponding new procedure
                  during execution. Updating a procedure involves
                  changing the binding from its current version to the
                  new version. When all procedures have been replaced
                  by their corresponding new versions, the program
                  update is completed.},

	Contribution1 = {The authors identify a set of general requirements for any dynamic updating system: preserving program correctness (during and after the upgrade), minimizing human intervention (both during and after the upgrade), supporting program restructuring and low-level program changes (e.g., both implementations and interfaces), supporting distributed programs (communicating across mutually distrustful administrative domains), not requiring special-purpose hardware and not constraining the language and environment. They also indicate that all updating systems require inserting a layer of indirection between the program modules that invoke each other.},
	Contribution2 = {Replacing abstract data types or modules: an old implementation is changed with a new one; version tagging and data conversion may also be required. This does not address the general problem of code restructuring.},
	Contribution3 = {Replacing servers in client-server systems: similar, but coarser granularity than previous approach. May need to update all dependent services simultaneously; the services are disabled during the update; can use crash-recovery facilities for providing data consistency (e.g., Bloom & Liskov's Argus). Assumes that only the implementation of a service changes between versions, but not the interface.},
	Contribution4 = {Updating in constrained message-passing systems (e.g., Kramer & Magee's Conic): modules communicate unidirectional, typed channels; a configuration manager handles updating by changing the module connections and copying state when modules are inactive. This precludes a module from selecting where to send a request at runtime.},
	Contribution5 = {Updating programs in procedural languages (e.g., C): more generic (can do general code restructuring, procedural languages are everywhere), harder to do (need to handle all the hairy details of a language like C). May require changes to the compiler/OS for building a transparent indirection layer; may require access to source code or other compilation artifacts (e.g., the procedure-call graph).},
	Contribution6 = {States that dynamic linking does not provide true dynamic updating capabilities because changing a dynamic library typically requires restarting the program, there is no correctness-preserving mechanism and there are no provisions for mapping library state across versions.},
	Contribution7 = {Presents PODUS (designed by the authors): changes virtual memory system and C compiler to handle procedure addresses that contain location, version information and that use a binding table as layer of indirection. PODUS loads a new version of a program into memory and then upgrades each procedure by changing its address in the binding table. Only inactive procedures are updated (not on the program stack and cannot invoke another active procedure, either directly or indirectly); static data is copied over. All inactive procedures are updated before one of them is invoked. ``Interprocedures'' are used to allow an old procedure to invoke a new one (with a possibly modified interface); they perform all the necessary data conversions and they must be provided together with the new version of the program. The upgrade process is coordinated (possibly remotely) by an ``updating system shell'. By using RPC to preserve procedure-call semantics across procedure boundaries, PODUS can handle distributed systems with only few modifications.},
	Contribution8 = {The requirements of PODUS: programs must be written in a top-down manner (only inactive procedures are updated and the main() function is never inactive); data used by global procedures (e.g., global variables) is accessed through abstract data types. Requires programmers to specify all the possible hidden dependencies between procedures. Programs must have a single thread of control. Backward compatibility in PODUS: an old procedure can invoke a new one (through and interprocedure), but not the other way. PODUS can upgrade distributed C programs in a pretty general way, transparently to the application programmer (the OS and compiler require some changes), preserving correctness and with little overhead (the upgrade requires only modifying the addresses in the binding table; the indirection can be efficiently implemented through the virtual memory system. PODUS can change both the implementation and the interface of a procedure, as long as the backward compatibility requirement is satisfied (the sequence of procedures invoked in the main() routine must stay the same).},

	Contribution1 = {The user is required to check if the patch makes semantic changes to the program's persistent data structures (e.g., adding a field to a data structure, changing the data initialization), which would require the existing instances to be transformed. The user is also required to write additional code to handle these transformations. Ksplice can perform the remaining steps automatically.},
	Contribution2 = {Ksplice does not require an indirection layer. It relies on dynamic linking (more specifically, on the ability to load kernel modules at runtime) and on the authorization to overwrite, in memory, the beginning of an old function with a jump instruction to the new function.},
	Contribution3 = {Defines safety as updating all the changed functions, including the ones inlined in the running kernel, and not applying updates if the running kernel does not correspond to the source code provided. This is a weaker property than the type-safe updates provided by DSU approaches that operate at the source-code level (e.g., Ginseng~\cite{Neamtiu06:PracticalDSU}), but it is probably appropriate for languages that don't put much emphasis on type safety, such as C or assembly.},
	Contribution4 = {The evaluation provides some clues on how useful are Ksplice's capabilities: out of 64 patches, 8 required writing additional code (because they changed the data-structure semantics); 8 modified function interfaces or patched functions with static local variables; 20 modified functions that had been inlined in the running kernel (in only 4 of these cases the function was declared {\tt inline} explicitly); 5 modified functions that contained symbols with ambiguous names (there are 6,164 symbols that share their name with other symbols in the Debian kernel).},
	Contribution5 = {Identifies challenges and solutions for DSU operating at the object-code layer: (i) the patch cannot be compiled separately from the rest of the kernel because compiler optimizations can obscure the site of the desired changes and because changing the length of a single function will alter the relative jump offsets throughout the entire object file; (ii) because this approach operates without an indirection layer, it is impossible to the symbols in the patch by using only the C source code of the running program and its complete symbol table (e.g., two or more local symbols with the same name cannot be distinguished from each other); (iii) it is impossible to determine which functions have been inlined (this is a compiler optimization, not indicated explicitly in the object code). Ksplice produces the object code of the patched functions by comparing the old and new versions, compiled using the same compiler and optimizations as the running program (``pre-post differencing'') and checks the object code of the old version against the running program (``run-pre matching'') in order to ensure safety (e.g., by verifying that the functions have been inlined in the same way and that the correct source code was provided) and to replace the symbols and the jump offsets with the ones used in the running program. The object code used in the pre-post differencing step must use a separate section for each C function and data structure (i.e., the code must be produced with the {\tt -ffunction-sections} and {\tt -fdata-sections} compiler options) in order to avoid superfluous changes and assumptions about the memory layout of the running program.},

	Summary = {Proposes dynamic software updates that operate at the object-code layer (assembled machine code with relocatable symbols), rather than on the original source code. This allows Ksplice to update programs written in either C or assembly without any language-specific considerations. For instance, Ksplice is the first system able to update dynamically a legacy operating-system kernel (which does not need to have been specially compiled before). This approach requires the source code of the old and new versions, which are compiled, with the same compiler used for the running kernel, and compared at the object-code level; the changed functions are bundled into a kernel module that is loaded dynamically. Ksplice targets security patches, which are ``usually designed to change the software as little as possible''. Ksplice can apply three years' worth of security patches to the Linux kernel for x86-32, which fix vulnerabilities with greater consequences than denial of service (i.e., privilege escalation, information disclosure), without rebooting (8 out of the 64 patches require source-code modifications).},
	Title = {{Ksplice}: automatic rebootless kernel updates},
	Weakness1 = {Because the semantic changes to the persistent data structures are difficult to detect at the object-code layer, Ksplice relies on the user for guaranteeing the safety of the updates. Moreover, the authors do not discuss the reason why only such data-structure changes require new code; other program transformations might also be too subtle for Ksplice to handle automatically.},
	Weakness2 = {States that Ksplice supports changes to function interfaces (pg. 8), but it is not clear how this is done. Guess: because parameters are passed either by unwinding the stack (x86-32) or through registers (x86-64), the modified manipulations of these parametes will show up as object-code differences at the call sites of the function and in its body.},
	Weakness3 = {Does not describe in sufficient the process of writing new code for patches that cannot be applied as-such. (States that ``the new code generally needs to perform a single task, such as walking a linked list to update all existing instances of a data structure.'') It remains unclear how much effort is required for adapting existing patches to the online updating mechanism, given the size and complexity of the patch.},
	Weakness4 = {Ksplice cannot retire the code of old versions; obsolete functions accummulate in memory, as the kernel is patched incrementally. The authors mention that updates can be reversed, by removing the jump instructions from the old functions, but they don't explain the mechanism in detail (how do they restore the bytes overwritten by the jump instruction?).},
	Weakness5 = {As most other DSU approaches, Ksplice cannot update active functions, which are always on the call stack of some thread in the kernel (e.g., the {\tt schedule()} function, because sleeping threads block in the scheduler).},
	Weakness6 = {Because Ksplice is evaluated with small code patches (mostly with less than 15 LOC), the limitations of this approach are not straightforward to understand. For instance, it is not clear if the updates could modify more than one function, whether function additions/deletions or other kinds of source-code refactorings are supported, and what challenges might Ksplice encounter when applying larger updates.},

@inproceedings{Neamtiu06:PracticalDSU,
	Abstract = {Software updates typically require stopping and
                  restarting an application, but many systems cannot
                  afford to halt service, or would prefer not
                  to. Dynamic software updating (DSU) addresses this
                  difficulty by permitting programs to be updated
                  while they run. DSU is appealing compared to other
                  approaches for on-line upgrades because it is quite
                  general and requires no redundant hardware. The
                  challenge is in making DSU practical: it should be
                  flexible, and yet safe, efficient, and easy to
                  use. In this paper, we present a DSU implementation
                  for C that aims to meet this challenge. We compile
                  programs specially so that they can be dynamically
                  patched, and generate most of a dynamic patch
                  automatically. Our compiler performs a series of
                  analyses that when combined with some simple runtime
                  support ensure that an update will not violate
                  type-safety while guaranteeing that data is kept
                  up-to-date. We have used our system to construct and
                  dynamically apply patches to three substantial
                  open-source server programs-Very Secure FTP daemon,
                  OpenSSH daemon, and GNU Zebra. In total, we
                  dynamically patched each program with three years'
                  worth of releases. Though the programs changed
                  substantially, the majority of updates were easy to
                  generate. Performance experiments show that all
                  patches could be applied in less than 5 ms, and that
                  the overhead on application throughput due to
                  updating support ranged from 0 to at most 32\%.},

This system uses code-rewriting to generate patches, static analysis to impose constraints on the kinds of updates that can be done and their timing, and dynamic linking to load the patches into an executable program. A modified C compiler determines the differences between two versions and rewrites the source code into an updatable form (adding the function indirections and type wrapping required). The static analysis indicates which functions and types can be safely modified at each update point. Most of these actions can be performed automatically. The authors demonstrate the practicality of this approach by updating 3 server applications, in each case applying all the historical releases from the first version to the most recent one.},

It states that many configuration problems stem from the fact that modern operating systems have shared libraries, which may be changed or deleted by package management software such as RPM, which may break some of the existing software. It also identifies some problems that are specific to RPM: you cannot define optional dependencies (e.g., don't install the GUI, which depends on X), which sometimes forces to applications to be split across multiple RPM packages; has only 1-level dependency resolution and doesn't know how to resolve a dependency tree; has a single-version dependency mechanism (you cannot specify a range of versions that would work), which exacerbates the shared library problem; RPM packages are monolithic (specification + actual software), which means that it is impossible to make complex queries on the structure of dependencies unless you download the entire repository; RPM makes it hard to install multiple versions of the same package on a system; software installed through other mechanisms cannot be detected (if a dependency is not in the database, it doesn't exist for RPM). The article doesn't talk about tools that were built on top of RPM to alleviate some of these problems (e.g., yum, apt-rpm), but it does review a different package management system (Portage) that addresses some of the mentioned shortcomings (more flexible dependency specifications, can resolve a dependency tree, limited support for co-existing multiple versions, source-based, which means that software is built and optimized on the system of destination).},

We know that refactorings are important; there are tools that partially detect refactorings; there are tools that can record and replay refactorings (CatchUp, JBuilder, planned for Eclipse 3.2). This paper tries to put all this together to enable the automatic update of clients using framework subject to API evolution. The idea is to detect refactorings in the framework automatically and to replay them in the client. The detection algorithm combines syntactic and semantic analysis in the following way: parses the two versions of the source files into abstract syntactic trees, then computes digital fingerprints (shingles) of methods, classes and packages to find similar pairs of entities, then performs semantic analysis (call graph, class hierarchy) on these similar entities. This tool outputs refactoring logs that can later be replayed using some other existing tools. The authors test their approach on codebases up to 350 KLOC, with a resulting accuracy of at least 85\%.},

This was done by manual analysis of software artifacts (release notes, source code), cross-checked with the output of a tool (Van) for automatic detection of API changes. Changes can be either non-functional (transparent bug-fixes or performance enhancements) or functional. The functional changes are either non-breaking (e.g., new APIs, deprecated methods, on-demand loading of legacy libraries) or breaking changes (the program is backwards-incompatible). The breaking API changes are either refactorings (modifications of the program structure) or intended behavioral changes, which modify the semantics of the application. Examples of refactorings are (in the order of the observed frequencies): moved method, moved field, deleted method, changed argument type, etc. Examples of behavioral changes are: new method contract (weaker/stronger pre/post conditions), implement new interface, changed event order (events fired by the framework), and new enum constant (may break some switch/case statements that rely on the number of constants). A breaking refactoring may result either in a compilation error, or an unintended behavioral change. The authors conclude that, while refactorings represent only a small part of all the API changes (less than 30\%), they have a big impact because between 81\% - 100\% of the breaking changes are refactorings.},

The authors conclude that: (i) while some projects steadily delete old variables and functions (SSH), others (Vsftpd, Apache) manage to avoid many deletions; (ii) while in all cases there are some changes to function prototypes, for OpenSSH these changes are much more frequent than in the other cases; (iii) most changes (additions/deletions) to struct, union and enum definitions affect predominantly one or two fields (with the exception of OpenSSH) and that fields do not change type very frequently.},

	Summary = {The authors present an approach for tracking dependencies (which may be affected by software patching) in Windows, through online self-monitoring. There are two types of relevant dependencies: shared libraries used by other applications and configuration settings, stored in the registry. The paper presents the Online Analyzer, an always-running process that tracks every application's accesses to registry keys and to DLLs, and that maintains an up-to-date list of the application's dependencies. Before a patch is applied, a simple query can reveal what applications are potentially affected by this upgrade (every Windows patch has a well-documented list of the DLLs and registry keys it modifies). This approach has the advantage that it can detect dependencies that cannot be discovered using static analysis: dependencies on libraries that are loaded on-the-fly and on specific configuration variables. It is not clear, however, for how long the system must be observed until the list of dependencies is complete (all possible interactions have been detected).},

Starting from a validated configuration (e.g., the one distributed on the RedHat installation CDs), the authors show that a system gradually drifts over time to a configuration that has not been tested. They compare the dependencies specified in the package header with the library dependencies of the executables packaged inside each RPM file, and find that there are only few errors in the way RPM dependencies are specified. However, the authors find extensive evidence of different versions of the same software in multiple RPM packages, packages mutually exclusive by design, inconsistencies inside the same package, multiple conflicts among RPMs corresponding to different modules of Apache and even libraries that declare to be the same version, but differ at binary level. This introduces version skew, which will eventually break a system because the newer versions of the upgraded libraries are not functionally compatible with the older versions.},

	Summary = {Describes a problem known as DLL Hell: ``after installing a new application, one or more existing programs quit working''. The author identifies three types of DLL Hell: (1) an installer does not check the version numbers of existing libraries and installs an older version of a DLL used by multiple applications; (2) a newer version of a DLL is not fully backwards-compatible because it breaks applications relying on certain side-effects, such as undocumented class members that may be refactored or uncaught memory-access violations (i.e., some programs rely on a specific version of the DLL); (3) the most recent DLL version introduces a new bug. The author also reviews two mechanisms used in Windows 2000 to mitigate DLL Hell: Windows File Protection (WFP) and private (side-by-side) DLLs. WFP restores DLLs from the system directory after they are overwritten by an installation program or an administrator. WFP allows only DLL updates that are digitally signed with Microsoft's signature. Private DLLs reside in the same directory as the executable program of the application. When instructed to do so, Windows will load these libraries instead of the system DLLs. However, some DLLs cannot run side-by-side because they need to maintain cross-process state. The author also claims that WFP completely eliminates type 1 of DLL Hell and that installing only service packs (instead of new releases with additional features) eliminates type 3, but this does seem to take into account the fact that unprotected DLLs may also be shared and that bug fixes may also introduce new bugs.},

	Abstract = {Enterprise-system upgrades are unreliable and often produce downtime or data-loss. Errors in the upgrade procedure, such as broken dependencies, constitute the leading cause of upgrade failures. We propose a novel upgrade-centric fault model, based on data from three independent sources, which focuses on the impact of procedural errors rather than software defects. We show that current approaches for upgrading enterprise systems, such as rolling upgrades, are vulnerable to these faults because the upgrade is not an atomic operation and it risks breaking hidden dependencies among the distributed system-components. We also present a mechanism for tolerating complex procedural errors during an upgrade. Our system, called Imago, improves availability in the fault-free case, by performing an online upgrade, and in the faulty case, by reducing the risk of failure due to breaking hidden dependencies. Imago performs an end-to-end upgrade atomically and dependably by dedicating separate resources to the new version and by isolating the old version from the upgrade procedure. Through fault injection, we show that Imago is more reliable than online-upgrade approaches that rely on dependency-tracking and that create system states with mixed versions.},

	Abstract = {We report on the aftermath of the discovery of a severe vulnerability in the Debian Linux version of OpenSSL. Systems affected by the bug generated predictable random numbers, most importantly public/private keypairs. To study user response to this vulnerability, we collected a novel dataset of daily remote scans of over 50,000 SSL/TLS-enabled Web servers, of which 751 displayed vulnerable certificates. We report three primary results. First, as expected from previous work, we find an extremely slow rate of fixing, with 30% of the hosts vulnerable when we began our survey on day 4 after disclosure still vulnerable almost six months later. However, unlike conventional vulnerabilities, which typically show a short, fast fixing phase, we observe a much flatter curve with fixing extending six months after the announcement. Second, we identify some predictive factors for the rate of upgrading. Third, we find that certificate authorities continued to issue certificates to servers with weak keys long after the vulnerability was disclosed.},

@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/imc/MooreSc02,
	Abstract = {On July 19, 2001, more than 359,000 computers connected to the Internet were infected with the Code-Red (CRv2) worm in less than 14 hours. The cost of this epidemic, including subsequent strains of Code-Red, is estimated to be in excess of $2.6 billion. Despite the global damage caused by this attack, there have been few serious attempts to characterize the spread of the worm, partly due to the challenge of collecting global information about worms. Using a technique that enables global detection of worm spread, we collected and analyzed data over a period of 45 days beginning July 2nd, 2001 to determine the characteristics of the spread of Code-Red throughout the Internet.In this paper, we describe the methodology we use to trace the spread of Code-Red, and then describe the results of our trace analyses. We first detail the spread of the Code-Red and CodeRedII worms in terms of infection and deactivation rates. Even without being optimized for spread of infection, Code-Red infection rates peaked at over 2,000 hosts per minute. We then examine the properties of the infected host population, including geographic location, weekly and diurnal time effects, top-level domains, and ISPs. We demonstrate that the worm was an international event, infection activity exhibited time-of-day effects, and found that, although most attention focused on large corporations, the Code-Red worm primarily preyed upon home and small business users. We also qualified the effects of DHCP on measurements of infected hosts and determined that IP addresses are not an accurate measure of the spread of a worm on timescales longer than 24 hours. Finally, the experience of the Code-Red worm demonstrates that wide-spread vulnerabilities in Internet hosts can be exploited quickly and dramatically, and that techniques other than host patching are required to mitigate Internet worms.},

	Abstract = {Fast and effective distribution of software updates (a.k.a. patches) to millions of Internet users has evolved into a critical task over the last years. In this paper, we characterize Windows Update, one of the largest update services in the world, with the aim to draw general guidelines on how to best design and architect a fast and effective planet-scale patch dissemination system. To this end, we analyze an extensive set of data traces collected over the period of a year, consisting of billions of queries from over 300 million computers. Based on empirical observations and analytical results, we identify interesting properties of today's update traffic and user behavior.Building on this analysis, we consider alternative patch delivery strategies such as caching and peer-to-peer and evaluate their performance. We identify key factors that determine the effectiveness of these schemes in reducing the server workload and the network traffic, and in speeding-up the patch delivery. Most of our findings are invariant properties induced by either user behavior or architectural characteristics of today's Internet, and thus apply to the general problem of Internet-wide dissemination of software updates.},

@article{DBLP:journals/expert/HalevyNP09,
	Abstract = {At Brown University, there is excitement of having access to the Brown Corpus, containing one million English words. Since then, we have seen several notable corpora that are about 100 times larger, and in 2006, Google released a trillion-word corpus with frequency counts for all sequences up to five words long. In some ways this corpus is a step backwards from the Brown Corpus: it's taken from unfiltered Web pages and thus contains incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammatical errors, and all sorts of other errors. It's not annotated with carefully hand-corrected part-of-speech tags. But the fact that it's a million times larger than the Brown Corpus outweighs these drawbacks. A trillion-word corpus - along with other Web-derived corpora of millions, billions, or trillions of links, videos, images, tables, and user interactions - captures even very rare aspects of human behavior. So, this corpus could serve as the basis of a complete model for certain tasks - if only we knew how to extract the model from the data.},

	Abstract = {Despite major advances in the engineering of maintainable and robust software over the years, upgrading software remains a primitive and error-prone activity. In this paper, we argue that several problems with upgrading software are caused by a poor integration between upgrade deployment, user-machine testing, and problem reporting. To support this argument, we present a characterization of softwareupgrades resulting from a survey we conducted of 50 system administrators. Motivated by the survey results, we present Mirage, a distributed framework for integrating upgrade deployment, user-machine testing, and problem reporting into the overall upgrade development process. Our evaluation focuses on the most novel aspect of Mirage, namely its staged upgrade deployment based on the clustering of usermachines according to their environments and configurations. Our results suggest that Mirage's staged deployment is effective for real upgrade problems.},

@article{DBLP:journals/tissec/McHugh00,
	Abstract = {In 1998 and again in 1999, the Lincoln Laboratory of MIT conducted a comparative evaluation of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) developed under DARPA funding. While this evaluation represents a significant and monumental undertaking, there are a number of issues associated with its design and execution that remain unsettled. Some methodologies used in the evaluation are questionable and may have biased its results. One problem is that the evaluators have published relatively little concerning some of the more critical aspects of their work, such as validation of their test data. The appropriateness of the evaluation techniques used needs further investigation. The purpose of this article is to attempt to identify the shortcomings of the Lincoln Lab effort in the hope that future efforts of this kind will be placed on a sounder footing. Some of the problems that the article points out might well be resolved if the evaluators were to publish a detailed description of their procedures and the rationale that led to their adoption, but other problems would clearly remain./par>},

Motivated by the standard signature-based technique for detecting viruses, and a recent successful text classification method, we explore the idea of automatically detecting new malicious code using the collected dataset of the benign and malicious code. We obtained accuracy of 100% in the training data, and 98% in 3-fold cross-validation.},

In: Virus Bulletin Conference, 2000) just partially addressed this issue and gave only existence results, we give here constructive results of undetectable malware. We show that any existing detection techniques can be modelled by one or more statistical tests. Consequently, the concepts of false positive and non detection are precisely defined. The concept of test simulability is then presented and enables us to gives constructive results how undetectable malware could be developped by an attacker. Practical applications of this statistical model are proposed. Finally, we give a statistical variant of Cohens undecidability results of virus detection.},

	Abstract = {Polymorphic malcode remains a troubling threat. The ability formal code to automatically transform into semantically equivalent variants frustrates attempts to rapidly construct a single, simple, easily verifiable representation. We present a quantitative analysis of the strengths and limitations of shellcode polymorphism and consider its impact on current intrusion detection practice. We focus on the nature of shellcode decoding routines. The empirical evidence we gather helps show that modeling the class of self-modifying code is likely intractable by known methods, including both statistical constructs and string signatures. In addition, we develop and present measures that provide insight into the capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses of polymorphic engines. In order to explore countermeasures to future polymorphic threats, we show how to improve polymorphic techniques and create a proof-of-concept engine expressing these improvements. Our results indicate that the class of polymorphic behavior is too greatly spread and varied to model effectively. Our analysis also supplies a novel way to understand the limitations of current signature-based techniques. We conclude that modeling normal content is ultimately a more promising defense mechanism than modeling malicious or abnormal content.},

	Abstract = {The security demands on modern system administration
                  are enormous and getting worse. Chief among these
                  demands, administrators must monitor the continual
                  ongoing disclosure of software vulnerabilities that
                  have the potential to compromise their systems in
                  some way. Such vulnerabilities include buffer
                  overflow errors, improperly validated inputs, and
                  other unanticipated attack modalities. In 2008, over
                  7,400 new vulnerabilities were disclosed--well over
                  100 per week. While no enterprise is affected by all
                  of these disclosures, administrators commonly face
                  many outstanding vulnerabilities across the software
                  systems they manage. Vulnerabilities can be
                  addressed by patches, reconfigurations, and other
                  workarounds; however, these actions may incur
                  down-time or unforeseen side-effects. Thus, a key
                  question for systems administrators is which
                  vulnerabilities to prioritize. From publicly
                  available databases that document past
                  vulnerabilities, we show how to train classifiers
                  that predict whether and how soon a vulnerability is
                  likely to be exploited. As input, our classifiers
                  operate on high dimensional feature vectors that we
                  extract from the text fields, time stamps, cross
                  references, and other entries in existing
                  vulnerability disclosure reports. Compared to
                  current industry-standard heuristics based on expert
                  knowledge and static formulas, our classifiers
                  predict much more accurately whether and how soon
                  individual vulnerabilities are likely to be
                  exploited.},

@inproceedings{Beattie02:TimingPatches,
	Abstract = {Security vulnerabilities are discovered, become
                  publicly known, get exploited by attackers, and
                  patches come out. When should one apply security
                  patches? Patch too soon, and you may suffer from
                  instability induced by bugs in the patches. Patch
                  too late, and you get hacked by attackers exploiting
                  the vulnerability. We explore the factors affecting
                  when it is best to apply security patches, providing
                  both mathematical models of the factors affecting
                  when to patch, and collecting empirical data to give
                  the model practical value. We conclude with a model
                  that we hope will help provide a formal foundation
                  for when the practitioner should apply security
                  updates.},

	Contribution1 = {The paper introduces the idea that the risk of applying a new patch (of unknown quality/robustness) is decreasing in time, while the cost of a security breach into an unpatched system is increasing. Therefore, patching should be delayed until the second risk outweighs the first.},
	Contribution2 = {The risk of applying the patch early includes: not enough testing in the field, unexpected interactions with the local configuration, the possibility that the patch does not fix the targeted vulnerability and the fact that appropriate patches are not always easy to find (leading to a labor-intensive search).},
	Contribution3 = {The risk of applying to patch late is harder to assess; according to one reference, systems containing month-old vulnerabilities with available, but unapplied patches, have a ``life expectancy'' measured in days.},
	Contribution4 = {The authors assess the probability of applying buggy patches by examining the patches released by multiple vendors between 1999-2001 and recorded in a vendor-independent database. They discover that patch revisions are usually released within 30 days after the initial revision, but this time can be as long as 500 days (it's a long-tailed distribution).},

	Opinions = {18\% (20 out of 112) of patches released between 1999-2001 were buggy. That's pretty high! I wonder if OS vendors with automatic upgraders (e.g., Microsoft, Red Hat) do any risk analysis similar to this one when pushing out security patches. A more rigorous study of bug-inducing changes is done in~\cite{Sliwerski05:when_changes_induce_fixes}.},
	Pages = {233--242},
	Summary = {Argues that there is a sweet-spot for the timing when security patches are applied: patches applied too early, without enough testing, may introduce critical bugs, while patches applied too late leave the system exposed to security threats for an extended period of time. Finds that 18\% (20 out of 112) of patches released between 1999-2001 and recorded in a vendor-independent database -- the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database -- were defective, which emphasizes the risk of patching too early.},
	Title = {Timing the Application of Security Patches for Optimal Uptime},
	Url = {http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa02/tech/beattie.html},
	Weakness1 = {The title is misleading: while it states that the paper aims for ``optimal uptime'', the metric used for expressing the cost is system-administrator time.},
	Weakness2 = {The theoretical model is quite disconnected from reality; none of the empirical results presented actually estimates administrator time. This metric is very hard to assess, so it is unlikely to be used in practice. Most of the equations presented are left in the literal form; the authors do not suggest values or estimation methodologies for many of the parameters used.},
	Weakness3 = {The authors estimate only the percentage of patches that are deemed defective by their vendor (by creating a new patch release). They don't estimate the percentage of patches that fail at a customer site due to conflicts with other software.},
	Weakness4 = {It is not clear even if the penetration risk starts off smaller than the defective-patch risk, which may invalidate the central hypothesis of this paper.},
	Weakness5 = {The authors mix up the concepts of ``cost'' and ``risk'' (probability*cost) in their notation.},
	Weakness6 = {The statistical treatment of the data is pretty shallow. It is not clear if the trends identified for the time needed for a patch to be deemed defective are stable or vary from one year to the next. Moreover, the sample size of 20 bad patches may be too low for these results to be statistically-significant.},

@phdthesis{Frei09:Thesis,
	Abstract = {Global Internet penetration and e-commerce have
                  grown explosively over the past years. Today,
                  information technology has become a backbone of our
                  industry and everyday life. We would intuitively
                  expect such an important technology to be well
                  monitored and protected. However, no one would
                  dispute that the constant discovery of new
                  vulnerabilities drives the security risks we are
                  constantly exposed to. As risk awareness is an
                  essential factor in human decision making, we are in
                  need of metrics to measure and monitor the risk
                  exposure of our networked economy and
                  society. Research on the economic consequences of
                  cyber attacks has dealt primarily with microanalysis
                  of specific events, technologies or targeted
                  organizations. The measurement of the cumulated
                  number of disclosed vulnerabilities over time is an
                  interesting and often cited indicator of the
                  increasing risk exposure. However, this measure
                  alone is not sufficient for an analysis or
                  understanding of the processes driving risk
                  exposure. Accurate knowledge of the vulnerability
                  discovery-, exploit-, disclosure-, and patch-time
                  (the lifecycle of a vulnerability) allows one to
                  identify different types of risk and to quantify the
                  risk exposure and evolution thereof at global
                  scale. A metric based on the vulnerability lifecycle
                  is vital to better understand the security
                  ecosystem. We build a comprehensive dataset of
                  30,000 vulnerabilities publicly disclosed since 1996
                  to reconstruct the vulnerability lifecycle. Based on
                  this data we analyze the risk exposure and evolution
                  thereof from a macroeconomic perspective.},
