@inproceedings{snow08,
	abstract = {Human linguistic annotation is crucial for
many natural language processing tasks but
can be expensive and time-consuming. We ex-
plore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk
system, a significantly cheaper and faster
method for collecting annotations from a
broad base of paid non-expert contributors
over the Web. We investigate five tasks: af-
fect recognition, word similarity, recognizing
textual entailment, event temporal ordering,
and word sense disambiguation. For all five,
we show high agreement between Mechani-
cal Turk non-expert annotations and existing
gold standard labels provided by expert label-
ers. For the task of affect recognition, we also
show that using non-expert labels for training
machine learning algorithms can be as effec-
tive as using gold standard annotations from
experts. We propose a technique for bias
correction that significantly improves annota-
tion quality on two tasks. We conclude that
many large labeling tasks can be effectively
designed and carried out in this method at a
fraction of the usual expense},

It is, however, more than this static resource alone. MindNet represents a general methodology for acquiring, structuring, accessing, and exploiting semantic information from natural language text. This paper provides an overview of the distinguishing characteristics of MindNet, the steps involved in its creation, and its extension beyond dictionary text.}
