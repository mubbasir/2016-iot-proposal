{\bf Pavlovic:} The prior most closely related NSF award is IIS 1135717 “RI: Small: Novel structured regression approaches to high-dimensional motion analysis,” 9/1/09 - 8/31/13, \$370,292. \emph{Intellectual Merit:} Predictive learning methods for human motion and human affective signals. Developed methods include novel dynamic ordinal regression approaches for modeling of the discrete intensity signal envelopes, and methods for inclusion of contextual information (subject-specific, event-specific) for improved event state estimation. \emph{Broader Impacts:} Contribution to the development of human resources in science and engineering by supporting and training over ten graduate students on these grants, in addition to 14 undergraduate researchers (five of them women and minorities) supported by REUs. Products resulting from both projects are 17 publications in leading conferences (CVPR, ICCV, NIPS, ICML, ECCV) and journal publications (T-PAMI, T-KDE, IJCV)~\cite{cohen2010,Kim:2010:SOO:1927006.1927056,Shariat2011,kim11kdd,kim11pami,kim2012icpr,nicolaou12eccv,rudovic12cvpr,rudovic12eccvws,shariat12acml,yi12icpr,kim2013,rudovic13iccv,rudovic13isvc,shariat13iccv,yi13iccv,rudovic2014icvs,nicolaou14pami,yi14icpr,rudovic15pami}. Two open source software were released at http://seqam.rutgers.edu.

{\bf Aleksandar Kuzmanovic} has done extensive work in 
congestion control \cite{ecn05sigcomm,ecn05rfc,web06par,tcp-lp,tcp-lpToN,hstcp-lp,extr08ccr},

He is currently the PI of CNS-1319086, \$473,445, 8/30/13 through 8/29/17, \emph{NetS: Small: Endpoint User Profile Control}. The \textbf{Intellectual Merit} of this proposal lies in developing auditing mechanisms on the web, and the key
\textbf{Broader Impact} of this proposal is the deployment of a set of first such tools for the Web; the list of publications resulted from this project is \cite{spam13pam,migration11wi,selective12wi,adver11icdcs,myths10wi,ad10www,ad10infocom,myths14tweb}, and the list of research products from this project is available at \url{http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/audit-content/}.
