  abstract  = "Abstract Human behavior modeling is a key component in
               application domains such as healthcare and social behavior
               research. In addition to accurate prediction, having the
               capacity to understand the roles of human behavior determinants
               and to provide explanations for the predicted behaviors is also
               important. Having this capacity increases trust in the systems
               and the likelihood that the systems actually will be adopted,
               thus driving engagement and loyalty. However, most prediction
               models do not provide explanations for the behaviors they
               predict. In this paper, we study the research problem, human
               behavior prediction with explanations, for healthcare
               intervention systems in health social networks. We propose an
               ontology-based deep learning model (ORBM + ) for human behavior
               prediction over undirected and nodes-attributed graphs. We first
               propose a bottom-up algorithm to learn the user representation
               from health ontologies. Then the user representation is utilized
               to incorporate self-motivation, social influences, and
               environmental events together in a human behavior prediction
               model, which extends a well-known deep learning method, the
               Restricted Boltzmann Machine. ORBM + not only predicts human
               behaviors accurately, but also, it generates explanations for
               each predicted behavior. Experiments conducted on both real and
               synthetic health social networks have shown the tremendous
               effectiveness of our approach compared with conventional
               methods.",

               hidden social influences make the problem more challenging. In
               this work, we propose a deep learning model named Social
               Restricted Boltzmann Machine (SRBM) for human behavior modeling
               and prediction in health social networks. In the proposed SRBM

               into three layers which are historical, visible, and hidden
               layers. The interactions among these behavior determinants are
               naturally simulated through parameters connecting these layers
               together. The contrastive divergence and back-propagation
